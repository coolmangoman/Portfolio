# Norman Ng - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I am Norman! I am on track to completing my Economics degree with a specialization in Quantitative Methods. I am passionate about using data to uncover meaningful trends and excited to apply my analytical skills to data science as an entry-level data specialist.

In my free time, I explore new tools and techniques to expand my knowledge. Driven by the thrill of discovery and solving complex problems, I thrive in both team and independent work settings. This repository showcases my skills, projects, and progress in Data Analytics and Data Science.

My CV in [pdf]().

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Examining the Causes of Employee Attrition

**Code:** [`employee_attrition.ipynb`](https://github.com/coolmangoman/Portfolio/blob/main/projects/employee_attrition/employee_attrition.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyse the factors leading to employee attrition and provide useful insights for future model-building.

**Description:** Using a fictional dataset from IBM, the analysis involves cleaning and exploring the data, followed by visualizing relationships between attrition and variables like job level, income, and department. The project concludes with recommendations for building a predictive model and addressing data inconsistencies for more accurate analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualisation.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit

**Results:** The analysis revealed that the employee's job level and income bracket appear to be most strongly correlated with whether or not the employee leaves, while factors like job involvement, total working years, and whether or not the worker has been promoted in the last 5 years having little correlation.


### Tech Store Sales Analysis

**Goal:** To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

**Code:** []()

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of sales records.  The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.

## Education

## Certificates
The best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result. Here's a list of the ones I have (in reverse-chronological order, with the date of completion in brackets):
