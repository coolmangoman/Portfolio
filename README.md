# Norman Ng - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I am Norman! I am on track to completing my Economics degree with a specialization in Quantitative Methods. I am passionate about using data to uncover meaningful trends and excited to apply my analytical skills to data science as an entry-level data specialist.

In my free time, I explore new tools and techniques to expand my knowledge. Driven by the thrill of discovery and solving complex problems, I thrive in both team and independent work settings. This repository showcases my skills, projects, and progress in Data Analytics and Data Science.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Examining the Causes of Employee Attrition

**Code:** [`employee_attrition.ipynb`](https://github.com/nrmnng/Portfolio/blob/main/projects/employee_attrition/employee_attrition.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyse the factors leading to employee attrition and provide useful insights for future model-building.

**Description:** Using a fictional dataset from IBM, the analysis involves cleaning and exploring the data, followed by visualising relationships between attrition and variables like job level, income, and department. The project concludes with recommendations for building a predictive model and addressing data inconsistencies for more accurate analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualisation.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit

**Results:** The analysis revealed that the employee's job level and income bracket appear to be most strongly correlated with whether or not the employee leaves, while factors like job involvement, total working years, and whether or not the worker has been promoted in the last 5 years having little correlation.

### Top Netflix Korean Dramas of 2023 Jan-Jun

**Link:** [`Netflix KDrama Dashboard`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/norman.ng4484/viz/NetflixKoreanDramas2023Jan-June/Main-Dashboard)

**Goal:** To analyse how factors like genre and number of episodes affect the rating and viewership of Korean Dramas on Netflix.

**Description:** Using Netflix's 2023 engagement report and data scraped from Korean drama database 'mydramalist', this project involved cleaning and joining two datasets on SQL, before using Tableau to visualise how various factors affect a Korean drama's rating and viewership.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data transformation, data visualisation

**Technology:** PostgreSQL, Tableau

**Results:** For Korean dramas, the top 3 genres (with more than 10 titles) in average viewership over the first half of 2023 on Netflix are Political, Sci-Fi, and Melodrama. Drama 'The Glory' was overwhelmingly popular, with almost three times the viewership of the 2nd-place drama. Korean dramas with fewer episodes tended to have higher viewerships (8 and 12 vs. 16).

## Certificates
The best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result. Here's a list of the ones I have (in reverse-chronological order, with the date of completion in brackets):
