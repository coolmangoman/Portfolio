## Portfolio Projects

### Korean Dramas on Demand 2023

**Code:** [`kdramas.ipynb`](https://github.com/nrmnng/Portfolio/blob/main/projects/kdramas/kdramas.ipynb)

**Link:** [`kdrama_dashboard`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/norman.ng4484/viz/UnderratedOverratedKoreanDramas2023/MainFigure#1)

**Goal:** To analyse how factors like genre and number of episodes affect the rating and viewership of Korean Dramas on streaming platforms in 2023.

**Description:** Using data scraped from two websites, 'FlixPatrol' and 'MyDramaList', this project involved cleaning and joining two datasets on Python, before using Tableau to visualise how various factors affect a Korean drama's rating and viewership.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data transformation, data visualisation

**Technology:** Python, Tableau

**Results:** Despite many dramas having 16 episodes, those with less episodes (namely 10 and 12) tended to have higher viewership. The genres attracting the highest viewership are Family, Military, Action and Adventure. More gritty dramas such as Military, Crime and Psychological Dramas had higher average audience ratings.

### Examining the Causes of Employee Attrition

**Code:** [`employee_attrition.ipynb`](https://github.com/nrmnng/Portfolio/blob/main/projects/employee_attrition/employee_attrition.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyse the factors leading to employee attrition and provide useful insights for future model-building.

**Description:** Using a fictional dataset from IBM, the analysis involves cleaning and exploring the data, followed by visualising relationships between attrition and variables like job level, income, and department. The project concludes with recommendations for building a predictive model and addressing data inconsistencies for more accurate analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualisation.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit

**Results:** The analysis revealed that the employee's job level and income bracket appear to be most strongly correlated with whether or not the employee leaves, while factors like job involvement, total working years, and whether or not the worker has been promoted in the last 5 years having little correlation.

### Analysing Superstore Sales

**Code:** [`superstore_sales.ipynb`](https://github.com/nrmnng/Portfolio/blob/main/projects/superstore_sales/sales.ipynb)

**Link:** [`Superstore Sales Dashboard`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/norman.ng4484/viz/SuperstoreSales_17238031775140/SalesDashboard)

**Goal:** To build a dashboard for upper management showcasing key figures and trends in Sales metrics such as revenue, profit, and average order value.

**Description:** In this 2-part project, I first cleaned two 'Orders' and 'Returns' datasets on Python, before using Tableau to visualise Sales data through the construction of a dashbaord.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data transformation, data visualisation

**Technology:** Python, Tableau

**Results:** In the dashboard, stakeholders first pick a metric to view (e.g Revenue, Profit, Order Volume). The dashboard displays the metric sliced across different dimensions like monthly sales, sales across different geographical locations and market segments. Several filters allow stakeholders to see sales performance from specific timeframes, continents, or product categories.
