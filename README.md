# Tianna Parris - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I am Norman! I am on track to completing my Economics degree with a specialization in Quantitative Methods. I am passionate about using data to uncover meaningful trends and excited to apply my analytical skills to data science as an entry-level data specialist.

In my free time, I explore new tools and techniques to expand my knowledge. Driven by the thrill of discovery and solving complex problems, I thrive in both team and independent work settings. This repository showcases my skills, projects, and progress in Data Analytics and Data Science.

My CV in [pdf]().

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing the Factor
**Code:** [`.ipynb`]()

**Goal:** To determine what factors

**Description:** 

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.

### Tech Store Sales Analysis

**Goal:** To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

**Code:** []()

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of sales records.  The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.



### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
